# umd_submit_cli
An alternative to the UMD Course Management eclipse plugin. Ideal if you do not use eclipse to program and want to submit your files in a more lightweight way.

Just run `submit_umd` in the directory where the `.submit` file lives and the cli will take care of everything for you.

Includes a progress bar, colors, error handling, and steps to help fix errors!

Please feel free to open an issue or pr if your project 
- Does not submit
- Uses an authentication other than 'cas'
- Utilizes the `.submitIgnore` or `.submitInclude` files
- Or if you have any enhancements to the cli!
